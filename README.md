My algorithm and DS exercises

 *classifications according to datastructures and competitive programming sites.
 *most of the folders have associates source file and a test file. In  test files, memory leaks and other stuffs are not   taken care, consider this just as a driver to test functionality of the functions in source code. These testfiles just   takes care of only functional testing and does not bother about other aspects of testing(which are equally important     but out of scope) like unit,coverage etc. Whoever refers these exercises are supposed to use their own test files :)
